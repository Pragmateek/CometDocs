CometDocs
=========

As of now there is no formal documentation but instead:
* an article that explains the ins and outs of this Cometdocs binding: [How to build a Java binding for a web API](http://pragmateek.com/how-to-build-a-java-binding-for-a-web-api/)
* the **unit-tests** suite.

To run the tests you'll need:
* a Cometdocs account: this will give you a **login** (your **email**) and a **password**
* a Cometdocs **API key**: you can get one from: [My apps](https://www.cometdocs.com/developer/myApps)

Once you've created your account you must create **a folder dedicated to testing** in your store.

The last step is filling the "**credentials.txt**" file with these data; you can simply copy and/or rename the provided template file "**credentials.sample.txt**" replacing the fake data by yours.
